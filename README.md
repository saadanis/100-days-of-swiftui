# 100 Days of SwiftUI Projects

## Overview
[100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) is a course by [Paul Hudson](https://mastodon.social/@twostraws) that teaches the basics of Swift and SwiftUI. This repository contains all the projects implemented from the course.

I originally completed the course in July 2020, but I am speedrunning the course again to refresh my memory.

## Projects
1. **Project 1:** [WeSplit](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16), Day 16 to Day 18.
2. **Project 2:** [Guess the Flag](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20), Day 20 to Day 22.
